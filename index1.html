                        <p style="align:justify">The academic discipline of Women's Writing as a discrete area of literary studies is based on the notion that the experience of women, historically, has been shaped by their gender, and so women writers by definition are a group worthy of separate study: "Their texts emerge from and intervene in conditions usually very different from those which produced most writing by men." 
                            It is not a question of the subject matter or political stance of a particular author, but of her gender, i.e. her position as a woman within the literary world. 
                            Women's writing, as a discrete area of literary studies and practice, is recognized explicitly by the numbers of dedicated journals, organizations, awards, and conferences which focus mainly or exclusively on texts produced by women. 
                            Women's writing as an area of study has been developing since the 1970s. The majority of English and American literature programmes offer courses on specific aspects of literature by women, and women's writing is generally considered an area of specialization in its own right.
