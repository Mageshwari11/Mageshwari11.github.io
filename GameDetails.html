            <h2 id="c"><u>COMBAT</u></h2>
        <p> The in-game combat contains actual martial arts as well as super-human abilities and elements from Chinese legendary stories such as depicted in films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero.[2][3] There are no classes or level restrictions. Instead the game uses a skill-based system in which the player has to learn new abilities and talents in order to progress. Combat depends on skill proficiency rather than any assigned numerical value.
            There are three types of skills, akin to the Rock-paper-scissors game: Overt (damage skills), Feint (defense-breaking skills), and Block (blocks incoming damage). There are also assorted skills outside of these categories. Utilizing skills consumes Energy, the equivalent of a Mana pool.
