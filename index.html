                <p><b>AGE OF WUSHU</b> is a <u>Massively Multi-player Online Role-Play Game</u> (<b>MMORPG</b>) developed by <b> SNAIL GAMES</b>.This game is a game of Martial Arts inspired by Wuxin, commonly known as "Martial Heroes" and the adventures of "MING DYNASTY".The original Chinese version, literally meaning : "Nine Scroll Manual" began beta testing in 2009 and was commercially launched in 2012. Over the next few years, the game was launched in more regions with different names: <b>North America (Age of Wushu), Europe (Age of Wulin), Russia (Legends of Kung Fu), Thailand (9Yin) and South-East Asia (Age Of Kung Fu).</b>
                On 6 January 2016, the mobile version Age of Wushu Dynasty was launched for both iOS and Android.Players initially select one of eight factions, and then develop their characters, learn new skills, and engage in <b>PvE</b> and <b>PvP</b> content. The game does not feature a class system, but allows players to join one of 8 player factions, or Schools: <b>Shaolin, Wudang, Emei, Beggars' Sect, Tang Clan, Scholar's Academy, Royal Guard and Wanderer's Valley</b>.The only restricted skills are the internal skills of each school. This means if a player leaves their faction, or school, the player loses the ability to use that school's internal skill.
                Quests and many other activities, including gathering, crafting and combat, give experience points which are converted into "cultivation" points used to upgrade fighting skills. Elements of the game include solo and party dungeons, an equipment system, crafting and professions, a housing system, and mounts. The attributes of Chivalry and Guilt determine the player's reputation and alignment in the <b>JIANGHU</b> System.</p>
